/**
 The base class for the navigation(routing) logic in VIPER arhitecture. Basically one router is connected with one container controller like PresentableNavigationController, PresentableTabBarController and e.t.c.
 All navigation logic as well as screen transition control should be kept it this 'Router' layer.
 Custom router can interact with 'Views' and 'Presenters' layers to setup screens in proper way.

 Custom router may contain:
 - Strong references to assembly interface
 - In most cases, strong references to base container controllr
 - Strong references to it's child routers ('childRouters' property)
 - Weak reference to its parent router
