/**
 Base class for all UX logic in VIPER arhitecture. In most cases views and presenters are connected one-to-one, but sometimes
 it's usefull to keep same UI with different UX logic.
 Your custom presenters may contain:
 - Strong references to any number of interactor interfaces
 - Strong references to custom service managers and services
 - Weak reference to custom router interface. User *'Interface segrigateion'* principle to design correct router interface.
 - Weak reference to one custom view interface
