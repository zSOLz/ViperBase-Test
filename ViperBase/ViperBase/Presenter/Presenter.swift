/**
 The Base class for the UX logic in VIPER arhitecture. In most cases views and presenters are connected one-to-one, but sometimes
 it's usefull to keep the same UI with a different UX logic.
 Custom presenters may contain:
 - Strong references to any number of interactor interfaces
 - Strong references to custom service managers and services
 - A weak reference to a custom router interface. Follow the *'Interface segregation'* principle to design correct router interfaces.
 - A weak reference to one custom view interface
